Barriers to DSMES exist at the health system, payer, health care professional, and individual levels. This low participation may be due to lack of referral or other identified barriers, such as logistical issues (accessibility, timing, costs) and the lack of a perceived benefit. Health system, programmatic, and payer barriers include lack of administrative leadership support, limited numbers of DSMES professionals, not having referral to DSMES services effectively embedded in the health system service structure, and limited reimbursement rates. Thus, in addition to educating referring health care professionals about the benefits of DSMES and the critical times to refer, efforts need to be made to identify and address all of the various potential barriers. Support from institutional leadership is foundational for the success of DSMES services. Expert stakeholders should also support DSMES by providing input and advocacy. Alternative and innovative models of DSMES delivery need to be explored and evaluated, including the integration of technology-enabled diabetes and cardiometabolic health services. Barriers to equitable access to DSMES may be addressed through telehealth delivery of care and other digital health solutions."

Other pump skin issues included lipohypertrophy or, less frequently, lipoatrophy and pump site infection. Discontinuation of pump therapy is relatively uncommon today; the frequency has decreased over the past few decades, and its causes have changed. Current reasons for attrition are problems with cost or wearability, dislike for the pump, suboptimal glycemic outcomes, or mood disorders (e.g., anxiety or depression)."

Most trials of these devices have included a broad range of people with type 1 diabetes but relatively few older adults. Recently, two small randomized controlled trials in older adults have been published. The Older Adult Closed Loop (ORACL) trial in 30 older adults with type 1 diabetes found that a hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery strategy was associated with significant improvements in time in range compared with sensor-augmented pump therapy. Moreover, they found small but significant decreases in hypoglycemia with the hybrid closed-loop strategy. Boughton et al. reported results of an open-label, crossover design clinical trial in 37 older adults in which 16 weeks of treatment with a hybrid closed-loop advanced insulin delivery system was compared with sensor-augmented pump therapy. They found that hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery improved the proportion of time glucose was in range largely due to decreases in hyperglycemia. In contrast to the ORACL study, no significant differences in hypoglycemia were observed. Both studies enrolled older individuals whose blood glucose was relatively well managed, and both used a crossover design comparing hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery to sensor-augmented pump therapy."
