        "output": "1. What is the risk of developing type 2 diabetes?\\nThe risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases with age, obesity, and lack of physical activity. It is also more common in people with hypertension or dyslipidemia and in certain racial/ethnic subgroups (African American, Native American, Hispanic/Latino, and Asian American). It is often associated with a strong genetic predisposition or family history in first-degree relatives (more so than type 1 diabetes).\\n\\n2. Does genetics increase the risk of diabetes?\\nYes, genetics can increase the risk of diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is often associated with a strong genetic predisposition or family history in first-degree relatives (more so than type 1 diabetes). However, the genetics of type 2 diabetes are poorly understood and under intense investigation in this era of precision medicine.\\n\\n3. How can individualized therapies for diabetes be developed in the future?\\nThe identification of individualized therapies for diabetes in the future will be informed by better characterization of the many paths to b-cell demise or dysfunction. Across the globe, many groups are working on combining clinical, pathophysiological, and genetic characteristics to more precisely define the subsets of diabetes that are currently clustered into the type 1 diabetes versus type 2 diabetes nomenclature with the goal of optimizing personalized treatment approaches. Many of these studies show great promise and may soon be incorporated into the diabetes classification system."

        "input": " ",
        "output": "According to page 84 of the 2023 Standards of Care in Diabetes, the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and processed food products with large amounts of refined grains and added sugars is strongly discouraged. This is because these foods have the capacity to displace healthier, more nutrient-dense food choices. While there is no direct correlation between sugar intake and the development of diabetes, consuming too much sugar can lead to weight gain and obesity, which are risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes."

        "input": " ",
        "output": "1. What is autonomic neuropathy and how can it affect physical activity?\\nAnswer: Autonomic neuropathy is a type of nerve damage that can occur in people with diabetes. It can increase the risk of exercise-induced injury or adverse events through decreased cardiac responsiveness to exercise, postural hypotension, impaired thermoregulation, impaired night vision due to impaired papillary reaction, and greater susceptibility to hypoglycemia. Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy is also an independent risk factor for cardiovascular death and silent myocardial ischemia. Therefore, individuals with diabetic autonomic neuropathy should undergo cardiac investigation before beginning physical activity more intense than that to which they are accustomed.\\n\\n2. Can physical activity accelerate the rate of progression of diabetic kidney disease (DKD)?\\nAnswer: There is no evidence that vigorous-intensity exercise accelerates the rate of progression of DKD, and there appears to be no need for specific exercise restrictions for people with DKD in general.\\n\\n3. Why do some people with diabetes experience hypoglycemia after exercise?\\nAnswer: In individuals taking insulin and/or insulin secretagogues, physical activity may cause hypoglycemia if the medication dose or carbohydrate consumption is not adjusted for the exercise bout and postbout impact on glucose. Individuals on these therapies may need to ingest some added carbohydrate if pre-exercise glucose levels are <90 mg/dL (5.0 mmol/L), depending on whether they are able to lower insulin doses during the workout (such as with an insulin pump or reduced pre-exercise insulin dosage), the time of day exercise is done, and the intensity and duration of the activity. In some people with diabetes, hypoglycemia after exercise may occur and last for several hours due to increased insulin sensitivity. Hypoglycemia is less common in those who are not treated with insulin or insulin secretagogues, and no routine preventive measures for hypoglycemia are usually advised in these cases. Intense activities may actually raise blood glucose levels instead of lowering them, especially if pre-exercise glucose levels are elevated. Because of the variation in glycemic response to exercise bouts, people with diabetes need to be educated to check blood glucose levels before and after periods of exercise and about the potential prolonged effects (depending on intensity and duration)."

What should we do to check for heart problems?\\n\\nA: According to the Standards of Care in Diabetes, the best protocol for assessing asymptomatic people with diabetes for coronary artery disease remains unclear. However, health care professionals should perform a careful history, assess cardiovascular risk factors, and be aware of the atypical presentation of coronary artery disease, such as recent reported or tested decrease in exercise tolerance in people with diabetes. Certainly, those with high risk should be encouraged to start with short periods of low-intensity exercise and slowly increase the intensity and duration as tolerated. Health care professionals should assess for conditions that might contraindicate certain types of exercise or predispose to injury, such as uncontrolled hypertension, untreated proliferative retinopathy, autonomic neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy, and a history of foot ulcers or Charcot foot.\\n\\nQ2: My husband's mother had blockage in her heart and was treated at Apollo Hospital in Hyderabad 10 years ago.

        "input": " ",
        "output": "1. What are the potential side effects of medications used to treat diabetes and high blood pressure in older adults with dementia?\\n\\nAnswer: The Standards of Care in Diabetes recommend simplifying diabetes treatment plans as much as possible and tailoring them to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia in the presence of cognitive impairment. The degree and duration of hyperglycemia are related to dementia, and more rapid cognitive decline is associated with both increased A1C and longer duration of diabetes. The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) study found that each 1% higher A1C level was associated with lower cognitive function in individuals with type 2 diabetes. However, the ACCORD study found no difference in cognitive outcomes in participants randomly assigned to intensive and standard glycemic management, supporting the recommendation that intensive glucose management should not be advised for the improvement of cognitive function in individuals with type 2 diabetes.\\n\\n2. How can I obtain information about my mother's medications and their potential side effects?\\n\\nAnswer: You can speak with your mother's healthcare provider or pharmacist to obtain information about her medications and their potential side effects. They can provide you with a list of her current medications and explain how they work, potential side effects, and any precautions or interactions to be aware of.\\n\\n3. Are there any specific medications that should be avoided in older adults with dementia who have diabetes and high blood pressure?\\n\\nAnswer: The Standards of Care in Diabetes recommend simplifying diabetes treatment plans as much as possible and tailoring them to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia in the presence of cognitive impairment. Healthcare providers should consider the potential risks and benefits of medications when treating older adults with dementia who have diabetes and high blood pressure. Some medications may need to be avoided or used with caution due to potential side effects or interactions. It is important to discuss any concerns or questions with your mother's healthcare provider."

        "output": "1. What are some recommended screenings for people with type 1 diabetes?\\nAnswer: Routine screening for thyroid dysfunction is recommended for all people with type 1 diabetes. Screening for celiac disease should be considered in adults with diabetes with suggestive symptoms (e.g., diarrhea, malabsorption, abdominal pain) or signs (e.g., osteoporosis, vitamin deficiencies, iron deficiency anemia). Measurement of vitamin B12 levels should be considered for people with type 1 diabetes and peripheral neuropathy or unexplained anemia.\\n\\n2. Can type 2 diabetes cause diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)?\\nAnswer: DKA seldom occurs spontaneously in type 2 diabetes; when seen, it usually arises in association with the stress of another illness such as infection or myocardial infarction or with the use of certain drugs (e.g., corticosteroids, atypical antipsychotics, and sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors).\\n\\n3. What are some symptoms that may be associated with diabetes?\\nAnswer: Diabetes is associated with a variety of symptoms, including polyuria/polydipsia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), peripheral neuropathy, anemia, and gastrointestinal issues such as diarrhea and constipation. However, it is important to note that these symptoms can also be caused by other conditions, so a proper diagnosis is necessary. Additionally, some people with diabetes may experience temporary remission from the need for insulin."

        "input": " ",
        "output": "1. Can sleeping on the floor cause nerve damage?\\nAnswer: The Standards of Care in Diabetes on page 88 mention that decreased pain sensation and a higher pain threshold in the extremities can result in an increased risk of skin breakdown, infection, and Charcot joint destruction with some forms of exercise. Therefore, a thorough assessment should be done to ensure that neuropathy does not alter kinesthetic or proprioceptive sensation during physical activity, particularly in those with more severe neuropathy. However, it does not specifically mention sleeping on the floor as a cause of nerve damage.\\n\\n2. Can diabetes cause nerve damage?\\nAnswer: Yes, the Standards of Care in Diabetes on page 88 mention that autonomic neuropathy and peripheral neuropathy are common complications of diabetes. Autonomic neuropathy can increase the risk of exercise-induced injury or adverse events through decreased cardiac responsiveness to exercise, postural hypotension, impaired thermoregulation, impaired night vision due to impaired papillary reaction, and greater susceptibility to hypoglycemia. Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy is also an independent risk factor for cardiovascular death and silent myocardial ischemia. Peripheral neuropathy can result in an increased risk of skin breakdown, infection, and Charcot joint destruction with some forms of exercise.\\n\\n3. Can excessive inhalation of whitewash paint or argon gas cause nerve damage?\\nAnswer: The Standards of Care in Diabetes do not specifically mention excessive inhalation of whitewash paint or argon gas as causes of nerve damage. However, it is important to note that exposure to certain chemicals or toxins can cause nerve damage and other health problems. It is recommended to seek medical attention if you suspect exposure to harmful substances."

Recently, I lost my health care and couldn t get metformin anymore, but then I also started a diet (it s not low carb or calorie deprivation-I eat @ 1300-1400 a day in 3 hr intervals) and have lost 25 lbs so far. I m still overweight, but I ve felt my sugar has been under control enough that, even though I have a few pills left, I haven t had to use any. Anyway, I ate my normal meals today, and right after eating dinner (fish & asparagus), I felt very faint and confused. I checked my sugar and it was 86. Is this normal? I haven t had any sugar symptoms since starting dieting except the other day, I felt like my sugar was high, so I took half a pill. First time in months. Could this half a pill have affected me that much? Is there anything else that would cause a low reading like that right after eating?",

        "output": "1. Can a healthy eating plan and weight loss help manage type 2 diabetes?\\nYes, in select individuals with type 2 diabetes, an overall healthy eating plan that results in energy deficit in conjunction with weight loss medications and/or metabolic surgery should be considered to help achieve weight loss and maintenance goals, lower A1C, and reduce CVD risk.\\n\\n2. Can long-term use of metformin cause vitamin B12 deficiency?\\nYes, long-term use of metformin may be associated with biochemical vitamin B12 deficiency. It is recommended to consider periodic measurement of vitamin B12 levels in metformin-treated individuals, especially in those with anemia or peripheral neuropathy.\\n\\n3. Can a low blood sugar reading occur after eating dinner?\\nYes, it is possible to experience low blood sugar after eating dinner, especially if the meal was low in carbohydrates or if you took too much medication. However, a reading of 86 is not considered low and may not be the cause of your symptoms. It is recommended to speak with a healthcare provider to determine the cause of your faintness and confusion."

        "input": " ",
        "output": "1. Is it common to not be on any medications once diagnosed with diabetes?\\n- According to page 30, unless there is a clear clinical diagnosis, diagnosis requires two abnormal screening test results. If two different tests (such as A1C and FPG) are both above the diagnostic threshold when analyzed from the same sample or in two different test samples, this confirms the diagnosis. However, medication decisions are based on individualized assessment of risks and benefits, and treatment goals. It is best to discuss with your doctor about your specific case.\\n\\n2. Should I contact my doctor again to ensure that not being on medications is accurate?\\n- It is always a good idea to communicate with your doctor if you have any concerns or questions about your diagnosis or treatment plan. You can discuss with your doctor about your specific case and ask for clarification on why you are not currently on medications.\\n\\n3. Should I be taking medications along with my exercise and diet changes?\\n- Medication decisions are based on individualized assessment of risks and benefits, and treatment goals. It is best to discuss with your doctor about your specific case and ask for their recommendation on whether medication is necessary for you at this time.

What are the recommended treatment plans for a non-healing toe ulcer in a patient with type 2 diabetes?\\nAnswer: The Standards of Care in Diabetes provide comprehensive guidelines for the management of diabetic foot ulcers. Treatment plans may include offloading pressure from the affected area, wound debridement, infection control, and glycemic control. In some cases, advanced wound care therapies such as growth factors, skin substitutes, or negative pressure wound therapy may be necessary.\\n\\n2. What is the significance of the patient's HbA1c, VPT, doppler, and ABI results in relation to their ulcer?\\nAnswer: The HbA1c level indicates the patient's average blood glucose control over the past 2-3 months and may impact wound healing. The VPT (vibration perception threshold) test measures the patient's ability to sense vibration and can indicate peripheral neuropathy, which may contribute to the development of foot ulcers. The doppler and ABI (ankle-brachial index) tests assess blood flow to the affected area and can help determine the severity of peripheral arterial disease, which may also impact wound healing.\\n\\n3. Are there any specific recommendations for the management of diabetic foot ulcers in patients with impaired blood flow?\\nAnswer: Yes, the Standards of Care in Diabetes recommend a multidisciplinary approach to the management of diabetic foot ulcers in patients with impaired blood flow.
